## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Event loop integration with calloop
- Basic client window management  
- Vulkan rendering pipeline completion
- Input device handling (keyboard, mouse, touchpad)
- Basic glassmorphism effects
- Side-docked app bar implementation

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-24 - "Foundation" üèóÔ∏è

### Added
- **Multi-crate workspace architecture** with 8 specialized crates:
  - `compositor-core`: Wayland server and protocol handling
  - `vulkan-renderer`: GPU-accelerated rendering foundation
  - `ui-framework`: Custom UI primitives and effects system
  - `app-bar`: Side-docked app bar (flagship feature)
  - `plugin-system`: Dynamic plugin loading architecture
  - `config`: Configuration management with hot-reload
  - `ipc`: Inter-process communication system
  - `utils`: Shared utilities and error handling

- **Core Wayland server implementation** using smithay 0.6:
  - CompositorHandler for surface management
  - XdgShellHandler for window management
  - ShmHandler for shared memory buffers
  - BufferHandler for GPU buffer management
  - SeatHandler for input device management
  - Proper protocol delegation and state management

- **Vulkan rendering foundation**:
  - Instance creation with validation layers
  - Physical device selection and enumeration
  - Logical device setup with queue families
  - Memory management infrastructure
  - Command buffer and synchronization primitives

- **4K-optimized architecture**:
  - High-DPI display detection and configuration
  - Performance-tuned build profiles
  - Memory-efficient buffer management
  - GPU acceleration for all rendering operations

- **Comprehensive logging and diagnostics**:
  - Structured logging with tracing ecosystem
  - Memory usage tracking and reporting
  - Performance monitoring infrastructure
  - Debug and development tooling

- **Professional project setup**:
  - Git repository with proper .gitignore
  - GitHub repository with public visibility
  - Comprehensive documentation (README, features, development diary)
  - Workspace-level dependency management

### Technical Achievements
- **Zero compilation errors** across all crates
- **Successful compositor startup** with hardware detection
- **Multi-GPU support** (NVIDIA RTX 3060 + Intel integrated)
- **Input device detection** (44 devices enumerated)
- **DRM device access** for direct hardware rendering
- **Async runtime integration** with tokio
- **Professional error handling** with anyhow and thiserror

### Hardware Compatibility
- **Tested on**: ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo (Debian 12)
- **Primary GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU
- **Secondary GPU**: Intel Graphics (ADL GT2)
- **Fallback**: Software rendering with llvmpipe
- **Display**: 4K capable with dual-monitor support
- **Input**: Comprehensive device support (keyboards, mice, touchpads)

### Development Infrastructure
- **Smithay 0.6** compatibility achieved
- **System dependencies** resolved (libpixman-1, libseat, etc.)
- **GitHub CLI** integration for repository management
- **VS Code** workspace configuration
- **Copilot instructions** for consistent development approach

### Dependencies
- **Core**: tokio, smithay, ash, glam
- **Graphics**: vulkan-loader, gpu-allocator, raw-window-handle
- **System**: nix, libc, input, libseat
- **Utilities**: serde, tracing, anyhow, once_cell
- **Math**: nalgebra, cgmath, approx

## Project Vision

This custom Wayland compositor represents a next-generation desktop environment with emphasis on:

- **Performance**: 4K-optimized Vulkan rendering
- **Aesthetics**: Glassmorphism and neomorphism effects
- **Modularity**: Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- **Innovation**: Side-docked app bar as flagship feature
- **Quality**: Production-grade Rust with comprehensive testing
