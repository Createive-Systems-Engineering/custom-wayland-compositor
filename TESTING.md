# Testing Framework Documentation

## Overview

The Custom Wayland Compositor includes a comprehensive testing framework designed to validate all aspects of compositor functionality, from basic window management to advanced graphics protocols. This testing infrastructure ensures reliability, performance, and compliance with Wayland specifications across diverse use cases.

## Test Client Architecture

### Core Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows a multi-layered validation strategy:

1. **Protocol Compliance Testing** - Validates adherence to Wayland specifications
2. **Performance Validation** - Ensures optimal performance under various workloads
3. **Integration Testing** - Verifies seamless interaction between compositor components
4. **Regression Prevention** - Maintains stability across development iterations

### Test Client Categories

- **`dmabuf_explicit_sync`** - Explicit synchronization protocol testing for GPU-accelerated workflows

## Testing Methodology

### Systematic Protocol Validation

Each test client targets specific Wayland protocols and extensions:

```
Core Protocols:
├── wl_compositor
├── wl_shm
├── wl_surface
├── wl_callback
└── xdg_shell

Extended Protocols:
├── wp_viewporter
├── wp_fractional_scale_v1
├── zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1
├── zwp_pointer_constraints_v1
├── zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1
└── zxdg_decoration_manager_v1
```

### Test Execution Framework

#### Individual Test Execution
Each test client can be executed independently:

```bash
# Basic window functionality
cargo run --bin shm_basic_window

# Advanced graphics testing
cargo run --bin dmabuf_import_render

# Input system validation
cargo run --bin pointer_events_logger
```

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
The framework supports batch execution for comprehensive validation:

```bash
# Execute all core windowing tests
./scripts/run_core_tests.sh

# Performance validation suite
./scripts/run_performance_tests.sh

# Protocol compliance validation
./scripts/run_protocol_tests.sh
```

## Test Documentation Structure

### Design Specifications
**Location**: `livetest/custom_tests/`

Each test category includes comprehensive design documentation:

- **Core Windowing Design** (`core_windowing_design.md`) - Specifications for basic window management tests
