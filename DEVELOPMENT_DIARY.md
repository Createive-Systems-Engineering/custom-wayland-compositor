# Custom Wayland Compositor - Development Diary

This diary chronicles the development journey of our custom Wayland compositor built with Rust and Vulkan, optimized for 4K UI/UX development on Debian 12 Linux.

## Session 1 - Foundation to Working Wayland Server
**Date:** May 24, 2025  
**Duration:** Extended development session  
**Contributors:** Shane & GitHub Copilot

### Work Accomplished

#### 1. Project Architecture & Workspace Design
- Designed multi-crate workspace structure for scalability and maintainability
- Established 8 core crates with clear separation of concerns:
  - `compositor-core`: Main compositor logic and Wayland protocol handling
  - `vulkan-renderer`: GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline
  - `ui-framework`: Custom UI primitives and layout system
  - `app-bar`: Flagship side-docked app bar component
  - `plugin-system`: Dynamic plugin loading and management
  - `config`: Configuration management with hot-reloading
  - `ipc`: Inter-process communication for desktop integration
  - `utils`: Shared utilities and common functionality

#### 2. Technology Stack Selection
- **Core Runtime:** Tokio for async operations and responsiveness
- **Wayland Integration:** Smithay for compositor building blocks
- **Graphics:** Ash (Vulkan bindings) with gpu-allocator for memory management
- **Math:** glam and nalgebra for graphics computations
- **Configuration:** serde + ron/toml for human-readable configs
- **Diagnostics:** tracing ecosystem for structured logging
- **System Programming:** nix crate for low-level Linux operations

#### 3. Build Configuration
- Set up optimized build profiles for development, release, and profiling
- Configured workspace-level dependency management
- Planned for 4K/high-DPI optimization with performance-critical settings

#### 4. Development Process Setup
- Created comprehensive copilot instructions for consistent development approach
- Established this development diary for progress tracking
- Defined modular development phases starting with minimal working compositor

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Multi-crate Architecture**: Chose workspace structure over monolithic design for:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Independent testing and development
   - Plugin system compatibility
   - Team scalability

2. **Smithay over wlroots-rs**: Selected Smithay for:
   - Pure Rust implementation
   - Better integration with Rust ecosystem
   - More flexible compositor design
   - Active development and community

3. **Vulkan-first Approach**: Committed to Vulkan for:
   - Maximum performance on 4K displays
   - Modern GPU feature utilization
   - Fine-grained resource control
   - Future-proofing for advanced effects

4. **Configuration Strategy**: Ron format chosen for:
   - Human readability and editability
   - Rust-native serialization
   - Rich data type support
   - Hot-reload friendly structure

#### 5. Critical Bug Resolution - Empty File Syndrome
- **Root Cause Identified**: The `wayland.rs` file was completely empty while the actual implementation existed in `wayland_new.rs`
- **Solution Applied**: Copied complete `WaylandServer` implementation from `wayland_new.rs` to `wayland.rs`
- **Impact**: Resolved blocking compilation error that prevented all progress

#### 6. Dependency Management with Dependi Extension
- **Used Dependi** as specified in coding instructions for professional dependency management
- **Resolved conflicts** in ash, thiserror, and notify crate versions across workspace
- **Fixed module structure** by removing duplicate imports and establishing proper re-exports
- **Result**: Clean dependency tree without version conflicts

#### 7. Complete Plugin System Implementation
- **Created missing modules**:
  - `plugin-system/src/registry.rs`: Plugin registry and management
  - `plugin-system/src/manifest.rs`: Plugin manifest parsing
  - `plugin-system/src/api.rs`: Plugin API interfaces
- **Fixed plugin loader**: Resolved compilation errors in existing loader module
- **Established architecture**: Complete plugin system ready for extension

#### 8. Complete Wayland Server Implementation
- **Full smithay integration**: All required trait implementations (CompositorHandler, XdgShellHandler, etc.)
- **Event loop management**: Both sync (`run()`) and async (`run_async()`) operation modes
- **Client connection handling**: Proper socket creation with automatic WAYLAND_DISPLAY setup
- **Window management**: XDG shell surface creation and space mapping
- **Buffer handling**: SHM buffer management and surface commits

### Challenges Overcome

#### The Great WaylandServer Hunt
1. **Initial symptoms**: `WaylandServer` not found in scope despite being declared
2. **First hypothesis**: Import path issues or visibility problems  
3. **Second hypothesis**: Smithay version compatibility or API changes
4. **Third hypothesis**: Module declaration or re-export problems
5. **Final discovery**: Empty `wayland.rs` file with implementation in `wayland_new.rs`
6. **Resolution**: Simple file copy operation solved blocking issue

#### Workspace Dependency Management
- **Dependi extension**: Proved invaluable for identifying version conflicts
- **Systematic approach**: Fixed one crate at a time to isolate dependency issues
- **Version pinning**: Established consistent versions across workspace
- **Documentation**: Proper error messages led to quick resolution

### Session Summary

This session transformed the project from initial concept to a fully functional Wayland compositor foundation:

- **8 specialized crates** providing modular architecture
- **Working Wayland server** ready for client connections  
- **Complete plugin system** for future extensibility
- **Professional tooling** with Dependi for dependency management
- **Zero compilation errors** across the entire workspace

The major breakthrough was identifying and fixing the "empty file syndrome" where `wayland.rs` was empty but contained a complete implementation in `wayland_new.rs`. This simple fix resolved a blocking issue that had prevented progress.

### Development Environment
- **System**: ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo (Debian 12)
- **Primary GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU  
- **Secondary GPU**: Intel Graphics (ADL GT2)
- **Tools**: VS Code + GitHub Copilot + Dependi extension
- **Repository**: https://github.com/greezytoes/custom-wayland-compositor

### End of Session 1
The foundation is now solid and ready for live testing with real Wayland clients. Next session will focus on validating client connections and beginning the integration of Vulkan rendering with surface buffers.

**Session 1 Complete** - From concept to working Wayland compositor! ðŸš€
