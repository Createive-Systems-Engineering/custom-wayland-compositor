## Session 1 - Foundation to Working Wayland Server
**Date:** May 24, 2025  
**Duration:** Extended development session  
**Contributors:** Shane & GitHub Copilot

### Work Accomplished

#### 1. Project Architecture & Workspace Design
- Designed multi-crate workspace structure for scalability and maintainability
- Established 8 core crates with clear separation of concerns:
  - `compositor-core`: Main compositor logic and Wayland protocol handling
  - `vulkan-renderer`: GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline
  - `ui-framework`: Custom UI primitives and layout system
  - `app-bar`: Flagship side-docked app bar component
  - `plugin-system`: Dynamic plugin loading and management
  - `config`: Configuration management with hot-reloading
  - `ipc`: Inter-process communication for desktop integration
  - `utils`: Shared utilities and common functionality

#### 2. Technology Stack Selection
- **Core Runtime:** Tokio for async operations and responsiveness
- **Wayland Integration:** Smithay for compositor building blocks
- **Graphics:** Ash (Vulkan bindings) with gpu-allocator for memory management
- **Math:** glam and nalgebra for graphics computations
- **Configuration:** serde + ron/toml for human-readable configs
- **Diagnostics:** tracing ecosystem for structured logging
- **System Programming:** nix crate for low-level Linux operations

#### 3. Build Configuration
- Set up optimized build profiles for development, release, and profiling
- Configured workspace-level dependency management
- Planned for 4K/high-DPI optimization with performance-critical settings

#### 4. Development Process Setup
- Created comprehensive copilot instructions for consistent development approach
- Established this development diary for progress tracking
- Defined modular development phases starting with minimal working compositor

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Multi-crate Architecture**: Chose workspace structure over monolithic design for:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Independent testing and development
   - Plugin system compatibility
   - Team scalability

2. **Smithay over wlroots-rs**: Selected Smithay for:
   - Pure Rust implementation
   - Better integration with Rust ecosystem
   - More flexible compositor design
   - Active development and community

3. **Vulkan-first Approach**: Committed to Vulkan for:
   - Maximum performance on 4K displays
   - Modern GPU feature utilization
   - Fine-grained resource control
   - Future-proofing for advanced effects

4. **Configuration Strategy**: Ron format chosen for:
   - Human readability and editability
   - Rust-native serialization
   - Rich data type support
   - Hot-reload friendly structure

#### 5. Critical Bug Resolution - Empty File Syndrome
- **Root Cause Identified**: The `wayland.rs` file was completely empty while the actual implementation existed in `wayland_new.rs`
- **Solution Applied**: Copied complete `WaylandServer` implementation from `wayland_new.rs` to `wayland.rs`
- **Impact**: Resolved blocking compilation error that prevented all progress

#### 6. Dependency Management with Dependi Extension
- **Used Dependi** as specified in coding instructions for professional dependency management
- **Resolved conflicts** in ash, thiserror, and notify crate versions across workspace
- **Fixed module structure** by removing duplicate imports and establishing proper re-exports
- **Result**: Clean dependency tree without version conflicts

#### 7. Complete Plugin System Implementation
- **Created missing modules**:
  - `plugin-system/src/registry.rs`: Plugin registry and management
  - `plugin-system/src/manifest.rs`: Plugin manifest parsing
  - `plugin-system/src/api.rs`: Plugin API interfaces
- **Fixed plugin loader**: Resolved compilation errors in existing loader module
- **Established architecture**: Complete plugin system ready for extension

#### 8. Complete Wayland Server Implementation
- **Full smithay integration**: All required trait implementations (CompositorHandler, XdgShellHandler, etc.)
- **Event loop management**: Both sync (`run()`) and async (`run_async()`) operation modes
- **Client connection handling**: Proper socket creation with automatic WAYLAND_DISPLAY setup
- **Window management**: XDG shell surface creation and space mapping
- **Buffer handling**: SHM buffer management and surface commits

### Challenges Overcome

#### The Great WaylandServer Hunt
1. **Initial symptoms**: `WaylandServer` not found in scope despite being declared
2. **First hypothesis**: Import path issues or visibility problems  
3. **Second hypothesis**: Smithay version compatibility or API changes
4. **Third hypothesis**: Module declaration or re-export problems
5. **Final discovery**: Empty `wayland.rs` file with implementation in `wayland_new.rs`
6. **Resolution**: Simple file copy operation solved blocking issue

#### Workspace Dependency Management
- **Dependi extension**: Proved invaluable for identifying version conflicts
- **Systematic approach**: Fixed one crate at a time to isolate dependency issues
- **Version pinning**: Established consistent versions across workspace
- **Documentation**: Proper error messages led to quick resolution

#### ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGIC PLANNING - Target Protocol Stack Defined!
**Timestamp:** 16:00

Based on Firefox connection issues and professional graphics application requirements (Blender-class), we've defined our **Target Protocol Stack**:

**Protocol Implementation Strategy:**
- **Priority 1**: Core functionality protocols (linux-dmabuf-v1, xdg-output-unstable-v1, etc.)
- **Priority 2**: Professional features (tablet support, advanced clipboard, etc.)  
- **Priority 3**: Performance optimization (GPU sync objects, power management, etc.)

**Key Insight:** By targeting Blender-level protocol support, we ensure our compositor can handle:
- Professional creative applications
- High-performance graphics workloads
- Multi-monitor creative workflows
- GPU-intensive rendering tasks

This approach guarantees our app bar will work flawlessly with the most demanding applications while providing the foundation for advanced glassmorphism effects.

**Updated features.md** with comprehensive protocol stack and removed duplicates for cleaner development roadmap.
