# Custom Wayland Compositor - Development Diary

This diary chronicles the development journey of our custom Wayland compositor built with Rust and Vulkan, optimized for 4K UI/UX development on Debian 12 Linux.

---

## Session 1 - Project Foundation & Architecture Design
**Date:** May 23, 2025  
**Duration:** Initial session  
**Contributors:** Shane & GitHub Copilot

### Session Goals
- Establish project foundation and workspace structure
- Define core architecture with modular crate design
- Set up development tooling and dependencies
- Create development tracking system (this diary)

### Work Accomplished

#### 1. Project Architecture & Workspace Design
- Designed multi-crate workspace structure for scalability and maintainability
- Established 8 core crates with clear separation of concerns:
  - `compositor-core`: Main compositor logic and Wayland protocol handling
  - `vulkan-renderer`: GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline
  - `ui-framework`: Custom UI primitives and layout system
  - `app-bar`: Flagship side-docked app bar component
  - `plugin-system`: Dynamic plugin loading and management
  - `config`: Configuration management with hot-reloading
  - `ipc`: Inter-process communication for desktop integration
  - `utils`: Shared utilities and common functionality

#### 2. Technology Stack Selection
- **Core Runtime:** Tokio for async operations and responsiveness
- **Wayland Integration:** Smithay for compositor building blocks
- **Graphics:** Ash (Vulkan bindings) with gpu-allocator for memory management
- **Math:** glam and nalgebra for graphics computations
- **Configuration:** serde + ron/toml for human-readable configs
- **Diagnostics:** tracing ecosystem for structured logging
- **System Programming:** nix crate for low-level Linux operations

#### 3. Build Configuration
- Set up optimized build profiles for development, release, and profiling
- Configured workspace-level dependency management
- Planned for 4K/high-DPI optimization with performance-critical settings

#### 4. Development Process Setup
- Created comprehensive copilot instructions for consistent development approach
- Established this development diary for progress tracking
- Defined modular development phases starting with minimal working compositor

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Multi-crate Architecture**: Chose workspace structure over monolithic design for:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Independent testing and development
   - Plugin system compatibility
   - Team scalability

2. **Smithay over wlroots-rs**: Selected Smithay for:
   - Pure Rust implementation
   - Better integration with Rust ecosystem
   - More flexible compositor design
   - Active development and community

3. **Vulkan-first Approach**: Committed to Vulkan for:
   - Maximum performance on 4K displays
   - Modern GPU feature utilization
   - Fine-grained resource control
   - Future-proofing for advanced effects

4. **Configuration Strategy**: Ron format chosen for:
   - Human readability and editability
   - Rust-native serialization
   - Rich data type support
   - Hot-reload friendly structure

### Challenges Identified
- **Vulkan Complexity**: Vulkan's verbose API will require careful abstraction
- **4K Performance**: Need to optimize for high pixel density from day one
- **Wayland Protocol Handling**: Complex state management for window interactions
- **Plugin System Design**: Balance between flexibility and performance

### Next Session Planning

#### Immediate Priorities (Session 2)
1. Create crate directory structure and basic Cargo.toml files
2. Implement basic Vulkan renderer initialization
3. Set up compositor-core with minimal Wayland server
4. Create foundational error handling and logging infrastructure

#### Technical Tasks
- Vulkan instance and device creation with proper validation layers
- Basic surface creation and swapchain management
- Wayland socket creation and client connection handling
- Tracing subscriber configuration for development debugging

#### Success Criteria for Session 2
- [ ] All crate directories created with proper structure
- [ ] Vulkan renderer can create instance and logical device
- [ ] Compositor can accept Wayland client connections
- [ ] Logging system operational with structured output
- [ ] Basic error handling patterns established

### Notes for Future Sessions
- Consider egui integration for development/debugging UI
- Plan performance benchmarking infrastructure early
- Design plugin API before implementing plugin system
- Research glassmorphism/neomorphism shader techniques

### Resources to Review
- Smithay examples and documentation
- Vulkan tutorial for memory management patterns
- Wayland protocol specifications for compositor requirements
- GPU-driven rendering techniques for 4K optimization
