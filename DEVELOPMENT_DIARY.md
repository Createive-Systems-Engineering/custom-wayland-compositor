#### 5. Critical Engineering Challenge Resolution - Empty File Syndrome
- **Root Cause Identified**: The `wayland.rs` file was completely empty while the actual implementation existed in `wayland_new.rs`
- **Solution Applied**: Copied complete `WaylandServer` implementation from `wayland_new.rs` to `wayland.rs`
- **Impact**: Resolved blocking compilation error that prevented all progress

#### 6. Dependency Management with Dependi Extension

- **Fixed module structure** by removing duplicate imports and establishing proper re-exports
- **Result**: Clean dependency tree without version conflicts

#### 7. Complete Plugin System Implementation
- **Created missing modules**:
  - `plugin-system/src/registry.rs`: Plugin registry and management
  - `plugin-system/src/manifest.rs`: Plugin manifest parsing
  - `plugin-system/src/api.rs`: Plugin API interfaces
- **Fixed plugin loader**: Resolved compilation errors in existing loader module
- **Established architecture**: Complete plugin system ready for extension

#### 8. Complete Wayland Server Implementation
- **Full smithay integration**: All required trait implementations (CompositorHandler, XdgShellHandler, etc.)

### Major Achievement: First Tier 2 Protocol Implementation

#### ✅ COMPLETE - xdg-decoration-unstable-v1 Protocol Support
Successfully implemented client-side/server-side decoration control protocol, expanding compositor capabilities beyond foundational protocols into professional application enhancement features.

**Protocol Significance:**
- **Window Decoration Control**: Enables clients to negotiate decoration rendering responsibility
- **Theming Integration**: Provides foundation for glassmorphism visual effects through server-side decoration control
- **Application Compatibility**: Essential for applications requiring custom title bars or consistent theming
- **Performance Optimization**: Allows optimal decoration rendering strategy based on application requirements

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Architecture Integration Following Established Pattern
**Import Structure:**
```rust

pub struct WaylandServerState {
    // ...existing protocols...
    pub xdg_decoration_state: XdgDecorationState,
    // ...
}
```

## Development Session Continuation: zwp-primary-selection-v1 Protocol Implementation

### Session Extension: Advanced Clipboard Functionality

**Objective**: Continue systematic Tier 2 protocol implementation by completing zwp-primary-selection-v1 for advanced clipboard functionality support.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Protocol Discovery and Resolution
- **API Research**: Discovered correct import path through compiler error guidance: `smithay::wayland::selection::primary_selection`
- **Dependency Chain**: Identified that `PrimarySelectionHandler` requires `SelectionHandler` trait implementation
- **Handler Architecture**: Successfully implemented both `SelectionHandler` and `PrimarySelectionHandler` with minimal required methods

#### Code Implementation
- **Import Integration**: Added `selection::{SelectionHandler, primary_selection::{PrimarySelectionHandler, PrimarySelectionState}}` imports
- **State Management**: Integrated `PrimarySelectionState` into `WaylandServerState` with proper initialization
- **Handler Implementation**: Added both required trait implementations with proper access patterns
- **Delegate Registration**: Successfully registered `delegate_primary_selection!` macro

### Compilation Success and Validation

#### Clean Build Achievement
- **No Compilation Errors**: Achieved successful compilation on first attempt after dependency resolution
