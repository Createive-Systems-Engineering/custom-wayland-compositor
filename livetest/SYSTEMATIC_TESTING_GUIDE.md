# Systematic Testing Guide
## Custom Wayland Compositor Testing Framework

### Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for systematically testing the custom Wayland compositor across all development phases, from foundation validation through advanced protocol implementation and production deployment.

### Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows a **five-phase progressive validation model** that ensures each component is thoroughly validated before proceeding to more complex integrations. This methodology guarantees that performance claims, architectural decisions, and feature implementations are rigorously verified at each stage.

### Phase Structure

#### Phase 1: Foundation Tests
**Objective**: Validate core compilation, dependency resolution, and basic executable creation.

**Critical Validations**:
- Workspace compilation across all crates
- Dependency tree resolution without conflicts
- Executable generation and basic startup validation
- Vulkan renderer unit test execution
- Surface manager component verification

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero compilation errors or warnings
- All dependencies resolve correctly
- Main compositor executable launches
- Core Vulkan renderer tests pass (12/12)
- Surface manager initialization succeeds

**Current Status**: [PASS] **PASSING** (All tests validated)

---

#### Phase 2: Graphics Stack Tests
**Objective**: Validate 4K rendering capabilities, Vulkan performance, and memory management.

**Critical Validations**:
- 4K swapchain creation and validation
- High-resolution memory allocation efficiency
- GPU device capability detection and verification
- Multi-surface rendering pipeline functionality
- Performance baseline establishment for 4K operations

**Success Criteria**:
- Successful 4K swapchain initialization
- Memory allocation stays within acceptable limits for 4K framebuffers
- GPU meets minimum requirements for high-DPI rendering
- Multiple surface rendering operates without frame drops
- Performance metrics meet or exceed baseline requirements

**Current Status**: [PASS] **PASSING** (4/5 tests implemented and passing)

---

#### Phase 3: Advanced Protocol Implementation
**Objective**: Validate Wayland protocol compliance, input handling, and window management.

**Critical Validations**:
- Core Wayland protocol implementation (wl_surface, wl_seat, wl_output)
- XDG Shell protocol compliance and window lifecycle management
- Input event processing and multi-device support
- Inter-process communication and client-server messaging
- Protocol extension support for modern desktop features

**Success Criteria**:
- Full Wayland protocol compliance verification
- Successful client application window creation and management
- Input events processed correctly across all device types
- IPC communication maintains low latency and high reliability
- Protocol extensions integrate seamlessly with core functionality

**Current Status**: [WIP] **IN DEVELOPMENT** (Phase 3 implementation required)

#### Phase 4: Custom Protocol Test Applications
**Objective**: Validate specific Wayland protocol features and compositor functionalities using purpose-built test applications for a granular baseline.
**Methodology**:
This phase involves developing a suite of small, focused test applications in Rust, using the `wayland-client` crate or similar safe Wayland client bindings. Each application or group of applications will target specific Wayland protocols or discrete compositor functionalities. Test groups will cover areas such as:
    - Core Windowing & Basic Rendering
    - DMA-BUF & Explicit Synchronization
    - Input Handling (Pointer, Keyboard)
    - Data Transfer (Clipboard operations)
    - Advanced Visuals & Session Features (e.g., decorations, layer shell, fractional scaling)

The design specifications for each test group will be documented in `.md` files within the `livetest/custom_tests/` directory (e.g., `core_windowing_design.md`). Similarly, execution results and validation findings will be recorded in corresponding `_results.md` files in the same directory.

These custom test clients aim to provide a highly controlled environment to verify the compositor's protocol adherence and feature correctness before moving to complex, real-world application testing in Phase 5.

**Critical Validations**:
- Correct parsing and handling of client protocol messages by the compositor.
- Accurate event dispatch from compositor to test clients.
- Proper state management in the compositor based on client requests.
- Validation of buffer sharing mechanisms (SHM, DMA-BUF) and synchronization primitives.
- Verification of input event propagation and coordinate spaces.

**Success Criteria**:
- Each custom test application successfully connects to the compositor and executes its targeted Wayland interactions.
- Compositor behaves as per the Wayland specification in response to test client actions.
- Expected visual output (if any) from test clients is correctly rendered by the compositor.
- Logs from test clients and the compositor indicate successful completion of test scenarios without protocol errors.
- Compositor remains stable throughout the execution of all custom test applications.

**Current Status**: PENDING DEFINITION (Requires Phase 3 completion)

#### Phase 5: Professional Application Integration
**Objective**: Validate compatibility with professional-grade applications and workflows. This was formerly Phase 4.

**Critical Validations**:
- Real-world application compatibility testing
- High-DPI scaling accuracy across different applications
- Performance stability under professional workloads
- Memory management under sustained usage
- Integration with existing Linux desktop infrastructure

**Success Criteria**:
- Professional applications launch and operate correctly
- 4K scaling maintains visual fidelity across all application types
- System remains stable under extended professional usage
- Memory usage remains optimized during long work sessions
- Seamless integration with existing desktop workflows

**Current Status**: ⏳ **PENDING** (Requires new Phase 4 completion)

#### Phase 6: Desktop Environment Integration
**Objective**: Validate complete desktop environment functionality and ecosystem integration. This was formerly Phase 5.

**Critical Validations**:
- System service integration and startup sequences
- Session management and user authentication workflows
- Hardware acceleration across all supported graphics drivers
- Power management and thermal optimization
- Complete desktop workflow validation

**Success Criteria**:
- Full desktop session operates reliably
- All system services integrate correctly
- Hardware acceleration functions across all GPU vendors
- Power consumption optimized for different usage patterns
- Complete workflow compatibility with existing Linux distributions

**Current Status**: ⏳ **PENDING** (Requires Phase 5 completion)
