# Testing Strategy
## Custom Wayland Compositor Test Architecture

### Strategic Overview

The testing strategy for our custom Wayland compositor is designed to ensure production-grade reliability, performance validation, and comprehensive protocol compliance. This document outlines the methodical approach to validating every component from low-level Vulkan operations through complete desktop environment integration.

### Core Testing Principles

#### 1. Progressive Validation Model
Each testing phase builds upon the previous phase's validated foundation, ensuring that complex features are only tested after their dependencies have been thoroughly verified.

#### 2. Performance-First Approach
All testing includes performance validation to ensure that our 4K and high-DPI claims are substantiated with measurable benchmarks.

#### 3. Real-World Simulation
Testing scenarios simulate actual desktop usage patterns, professional workflows, and edge cases encountered in production environments.

#### 4. Comprehensive Coverage
Testing covers functional correctness, performance characteristics, security implications, and integration compatibility.
