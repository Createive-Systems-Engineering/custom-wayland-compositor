# Results: Group 1 - Core Windowing & Basic Rendering Test Applications

**Date:** (Placeholder for test execution date)
**Compositor Version/Commit:** (Placeholder)

## 1. Overview

This document records the results of executing the custom test applications designed to validate core windowing and basic rendering functionalities of the compositor. The designs for these tests are specified in `livetest/custom_tests/core_windowing_design.md`.

**Current Status:** The test applications (`shm_basic_window`, `xdg_shell_interactions`, `surface_damage_frame`, `viewporter_scaling`) are currently skeletons. Full implementation of their Wayland client logic as per the design document is required before these results can be populated. The results below are placeholders and will be updated by the development/testing team once the applications are developed and executed against the target compositor.

## 2. Test Application Results

### 2.1. `shm_basic_window`
- **Objective:** Verify creation of a simple SHM window, display a solid color, handle basic lifecycle.
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/core_windowing_design.md#31-test-app-shm_basic_window`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "Window appeared with correct title and red color. Closed after 3 seconds as expected.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Compositor Logs:**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary of compositor behavior during test - To be filled)
- **Client Logs (`shm_basic_window` stdout):**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary of client logs - To be filled)

### 2.2. `xdg_shell_interactions`
- **Objective:** Test various `xdg_toplevel` interactions and state changes (ping/pong, maximize, fullscreen).
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/core_windowing_design.md#32-test-app-xdg_shell_interactions`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "Responded to pings. Maximize request led to configure event with maximized state. Window visually maximized.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Compositor Logs:**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary - To be filled)
- **Client Logs (`xdg_shell_interactions` stdout):**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary - To be filled)

### 2.3. `surface_damage_frame`
- **Objective:** Verify `wl_surface.damage` and `wl_surface.frame` callback mechanisms for partial updates.
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/core_windowing_design.md#33-test-app-surface_damage_frame`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "Initial window blue. Quadrant 1 changed to green, then Q3 to red. Frame callbacks received for each update.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Compositor Logs:**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary - To be filled)
- **Client Logs (`surface_damage_frame` stdout):**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary - To be filled)

### 2.4. `viewporter_scaling`
- **Objective:** Test basic surface scaling and cropping using `wp_viewporter`.
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/core_windowing_design.md#34-test-app-viewporter_scaling`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "Viewporter global was present. Upscale scenario resulted in a larger window with pixelated pattern. Cropping scenario showed only the center part.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Compositor Logs:**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary - To be filled)
- **Client Logs (`viewporter_scaling` stdout):**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary - To be filled)

## 3. Summary of Issues Found (Compositor Bugs)

- **Issue #ID:** (Brief description of bug - To be filled)
  - **Test Application:** (Which test app revealed the bug)
  - **Severity:** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - **Status:** (Open/In Progress/Resolved)

*(Placeholder: This section will list any bugs or protocol deviations discovered in the compositor through the execution of these Group 1 test applications.)*

## 4. Overall Assessment for Group 1

- **Overall Test Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **General Comments:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester: e.g., "Once implemented, these tests will provide crucial baseline validation for core windowing and SHM rendering before proceeding to more complex scenarios like DMA-BUF or advanced input handling.")

*(Placeholder: This section will provide a summary of the overall success and findings for the Group 1 tests once they are executed.)*
