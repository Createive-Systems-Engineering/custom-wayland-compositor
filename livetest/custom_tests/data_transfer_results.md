# Results: Group 4 - Data Transfer (Clipboard) Test Applications

**Date:** (Placeholder for test execution date)
**Compositor Version/Commit:** (Placeholder)

## 1. Overview

This document records the results of executing custom test applications designed to validate data transfer functionalities, specifically clipboard copy and paste operations for the `text/plain` MIME type, using Wayland's data device protocols. The detailed designs for these tests are specified in `livetest/custom_tests/data_transfer_design.md`.

**Current Status:** The test applications (`clipboard_copier` and `clipboard_paster`) are currently skeletons. Full implementation of their Wayland client logic, including careful management of `wl_data_source`, `wl_data_offer`, event serials, and pipe-based data transfer, is required. The results below are placeholders and will be updated by the development/testing team once the applications are developed and executed.

## 2. Test Application Results

### 2.1. `clipboard_copier`
- **Objective:** To offer data (simple text string) to the system clipboard.
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/data_transfer_design.md#31-test-app-clipboard_copier`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **Source Text Offered:** (e.g., "Hello Wayland Clipboard!" or from CLI param - To be specified by tester)
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "Application started. Triggered copy. `wl_data_source` created and `text/plain` offered. `set_selection` called with serial X. `wl_data_source.send` event was triggered when paster requested data.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Client Logs (`clipboard_copier` stdout):**
    - (Attach or summarize relevant snippets, focusing on data source events, offered MIME types, and `set_selection` calls - To be filled)

### 2.2. `clipboard_paster`
- **Objective:** To receive (paste) text data from the system clipboard.
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/data_transfer_design.md#32-test-app-clipboard_paster`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "`wl_data_device.selection` event received. `wl_data_offer` announced `text/plain`. Called `receive()`. Data successfully read from pipe.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Client Logs (`clipboard_paster` stdout):**
    - (Attach or summarize relevant snippets, focusing on `selection` events, `data_offer` announcements, MIME types received, and the actual data read from the pipe - To be filled)

### 2.3. Interaction Test: `clipboard_copier` & `clipboard_paster` (End-to-End)
- **Objective:** Verify the complete end-to-end copy and paste operation for `text/plain` data between the two test applications.
- **Scenario:**
    1. `clipboard_paster` is started and awaits clipboard events.
    2. `clipboard_copier` is started and offers its predefined (or CLI-specified) text.
    3. `clipboard_paster` detects the new selection and attempts to retrieve the `text/plain` data.
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **`clipboard_copier` Source Text:** (Specify text used by copier for this test run)
- **`clipboard_paster` Received Text:** (Paste the actual text logged/displayed by paster here)
- **Data Match Verification:** (Yes/No - Did paster's received text exactly match copier's source text?)
- **Compositor Logs (during interaction):**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary, especially any errors or warnings related to data device handling or serials - To be filled)
- **Test Clearing Selection:**
    - **Action:** (e.g., `clipboard_copier` calls `set_selection(None, serial)` or exits)
    - **`clipboard_paster` Observation:** (e.g., "Received `wl_data_device.selection(None)` event." - To be filled)

## 3. Summary of Issues Found (Compositor Bugs)

- **Issue #ID:** (Brief description of bug - To be filled)
  - **Test Application(s):** (`clipboard_copier`, `clipboard_paster`, or interaction)
  - **Severity:** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - **Status:** (Open/In Progress/Resolved)

*(Placeholder: This section will list any bugs or protocol deviations related to data transfer/clipboard handling discovered in the compositor through these Group 4 tests.)*

## 4. Overall Assessment for Group 4

- **Overall Test Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **General Comments:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester: e.g., "These tests are fundamental for basic desktop usability. Correct serial handling and pipe management will be key implementation details.")
- **Challenges Encountered (during test development or execution):**
    - (e.g., Debugging pipe read/write issues, ensuring correct serial usage for `set_selection` especially with auto-triggers - To be filled)

*(Placeholder: This section will provide a summary of the overall success, findings, and any specific challenges related to the Group 4 tests once they are implemented and executed.)*
