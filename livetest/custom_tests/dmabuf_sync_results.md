# Results: Group 2 - DMA-BUF & Explicit Sync Test Applications

**Date:** (Placeholder for test execution date)
**Compositor Version/Commit:** (Placeholder)
**GPU/Driver for DMA-BUF source (if applicable):** (e.g., Mesa Intel, NVIDIA proprietary, etc. - Placeholder)

## 1. Overview

This document records the results of executing custom test applications designed to validate the compositor's handling of DMA-BUF import via `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` and explicit synchronization using `zwp_linux_explicit_sync_v1`. The detailed designs for these tests are specified in `livetest/custom_tests/dmabuf_sync_design.md`.

**Current Status:** The test applications (`dmabuf_import_render`, `dmabuf_explicit_sync`) are currently skeletons. Full implementation of their Wayland client logic, including the critical mechanisms for creating or sourcing DMA-BUF and sync file file descriptors (fds), is required. The results below are placeholders and will be updated by the development/testing team once the applications are developed and executed against the target compositor.

## 2. Test Application Results

### 2.1. `dmabuf_import_render`
- **Objective:** Verify basic DMA-BUF import and rendering.
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/dmabuf_sync_design.md#31-test-app-dmabuf_import_render`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **DMA-BUF Source Method:** (e.g., Internal Minimal GBM, Internal Minimal Vulkan, External fd via CLI - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "DMA-BUF fd obtained. `zwp_linux_buffer_params_v1.created` received. Window displayed checkerboard pattern from DMA-BUF.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Compositor Logs:**
    - (Relevant snippets or summary of compositor behavior, esp. DMA-BUF import messages or errors - To be filled)
- **Client Logs (`dmabuf_import_render` stdout):**
    - (Relevant snippets: DMA-BUF parameters used, `created`/`failed` events, frame callbacks - To be filled)

### 2.2. `dmabuf_explicit_sync`
- **Objective:** Verify explicit synchronization with DMA-BUF using `zwp_linux_explicit_sync_v1`.
- **Design Document:** `livetest/custom_tests/dmabuf_sync_design.md#32-test-app-dmabuf_explicit_sync`
- **Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **DMA-BUF & Sync FD Source Method:** (e.g., Internal methods, External fds via CLI - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Observations:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester post-execution: e.g., "Loop N frames: Acquire fence set. Release fence set. Release fence fd signaled within X ms for each frame. Visual updates correct.")
- **Success Criteria Met:** (Yes/No/Partial - To be filled by developer/tester)
- **Compositor Logs:**
    - (Relevant snippets: Errors related to fence handling, DMA-BUF import - To be filled)
- **Client Logs (`dmabuf_explicit_sync` stdout):**
    - (Relevant snippets: Acquire/Release fence fd values, timing of release fence signaling, frame progression - To be filled)

## 3. Summary of Issues Found (Compositor Bugs)

- **Issue #ID:** (Brief description of bug - To be filled)
  - **Test Application:** (Which test app revealed the bug: `dmabuf_import_render` or `dmabuf_explicit_sync`)
  - **Severity:** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - **Status:** (Open/In Progress/Resolved)

*(Placeholder: This section will list any bugs or protocol deviations related to DMA-BUF or explicit synchronization discovered in the compositor through these Group 2 tests.)*

## 4. Overall Assessment for Group 2

- **Overall Test Status:** PENDING_IMPLEMENTATION
- **General Comments:**
    - (To be filled by developer/tester: e.g., "Implementation of fd sourcing is the main challenge. Once overcome, these tests will be vital for zero-copy rendering validation.")
- **Challenges Encountered (during test development or execution):**
    - (e.g., Difficulties with minimal GBM/Vulkan setup for fd generation, issues with sync file semantics - To be filled)

*(Placeholder: This section will provide a summary of the overall success, findings, and any specific challenges related to the Group 2 tests once they are implemented and executed.)*
